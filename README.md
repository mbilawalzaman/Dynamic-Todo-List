**Todo List App**

This is a simple yet modern Todo List app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DataTables library for enhanced table functionality. The app allows users to view, add, and manage tasks with an intuitive user interface, including features like modal forms and dynamic table updates.

**Features**
- Responsive Design: Looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
- Add New Todos: Use a modal form to add new tasks.
- Task Management: View and track the status of tasks (Completed or Not Completed).
- DataTable Integration: A dynamic table with sorting, pagination, and search functionality.
- Modern UI: Enhanced visual design with hover effects and smooth transitions.

**Tech Stack**

- HTML: Structure of the app.
- CSS: Styling and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Client-side functionality (with Axios and DataTables integration).
- Axios: To fetch data from an external API (for demonstration purposes).
- DataTables: To make the Todo List table interactive (with sorting, pagination, and searching).
- FontAwesome: For icons.

**Installation**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git

**Open the index.html file:**
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to start using the app.

**How It Works**
Adding a Todo: Click the "Add New" button, fill in the task title, and select the status (Completed/Not Completed). Once submitted, the new task is added to the table.
Dynamic Table: The tasks are displayed in a table that supports sorting, pagination, and searching, thanks to the DataTables library.
Modal Form: The form for adding tasks appears in a modal dialog to keep the interface clean and user-friendly.

**Dependencies**
jQuery: Required by DataTables.
DataTables: For advanced table features (sorting, pagination, search).
Axios: For making HTTP requests (though in this case, a mock API is used).

**How to Use**
Running Locally: Download the project files and open index.html in your browser.
Add Todo: Click on the "Add New" button, enter the task title, choose the status (Completed or Not Completed), and submit the form to add it to the table.
